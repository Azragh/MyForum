I translated all of the text to English.

This should NOT be used on live sites at this time.

How To Install:
1. Upload all files to your site root.
2. Upload the .SQL file to PHPMyAdmin. (You can find it in "/inc/")
3. Edit inc/connection.php with your database info.

How To Set Up Site Emails:
(You will have to edit the same thing in all 3 files. (edit 'Username', 'Password', 'setFrom', 'addReplyTo' with your email and password.
In the same file find 'Body' and 'AltBody' and change "http://localhost/" to your site url.)
1. Go to /inc/mails and edit the 2 files.
2. Go to /inc/forms/registerform.php and edit.

Enjoy!
